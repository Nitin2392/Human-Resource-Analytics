# Human-Resource-Analytics

A Human Resource Analytics project that addresses the question "Why do employees leave?". It also helps us better understand employee satisfaction by considering factors like:

1. Last Evaluation
2. Number of Projects
3. Average monthly Hours
4. Time Spent in Company
5. Work Accident
6. Satisfaction Level
7. Left / Not Left
8. Promotion in the Last 5 Years
9. Salary Order

My team built linear regression and logistic regression models to determine the best predictor variables. We determined the same by computing metrics such as Sum of Squares error (SSE) and R-Squared value. The dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics.
